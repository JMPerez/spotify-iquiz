# Spotify iQuiz

An iQuiz-inspired project using the Spotify Web API. It uses the 30s audio previews, cover arts and user's library together with the SpeechSynthesis API. And some other buzzword I forget.

It asks questions about:

- Artist's name
- Track's name
- Album's year

## Demo

Visit [this link](https://jmperezperez.com/spotify-iquiz/)

## Running it locally

Clone the project and serve it from `locahost:8000`. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/src`
to view the unoptimised version.

If you want to minify and combine files, run `npm run build` after installing the dependencies.
The `dist` folder will contain the output files.
